# Interactive World Map with Country Information

## Project Overview

This GitHub project showcases an interactive 3D world map built using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics. The map displays countries as pins, and when a user hovers over a country, a popup appears, providing information such as the country's population and name. The project utilizes shaders for enhanced visual effects.

## Features

- 3D World Map: Utilizes Three.js to create a visually appealing and interactive 3D representation of the world.
- Country Pins: Each country is represented by a pin, making it easy for users to identify specific locations.
- Hover Interaction: When a user hovers over a country, a popup appears, displaying essential information about that country.
- Shaders: Implemented shaders to enhance the visual experience, creating a polished and immersive interface.
